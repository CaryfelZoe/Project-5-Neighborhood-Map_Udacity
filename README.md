# Project 5: Neighborhood Map

1. Open index.html in your browser
2. Review the Project of the Neighborhood Map.
3. Exlplore the list of places to eat near Le Centre Pompidou.

## How I completed this Project?

1. Reviewed course JavaScript Design Patterns and Intro to Ajax.
2. Downloaded the Knockout framework.
3. Wrote code required to add a full-screen map to the page using the Google Maps API.
4. Wrote code required to display map markers identifying a number of restaurant locations near Le Centre Pompidou.
5. Implemented the search bar functionality to search and filter map markers displayed in step 4. The search function should filter on markers that already show up. 
6. Implemented a list view of the set of locations defined in step 4), Searching and filtering the locations via the search bar will filter the list view and map marker locations accordingly.
7. Added additional functionality using Foursquare APIs when a map marker, or list view entry is clicked.
8. Added additional functionality to animate a map marker when either the list item associated with it or the map marker itself is selected.
9. Added additional functionality to open an infoWindow with the information described in step 7) when either a location is selected from the list view or its map marker is selected directly.
10. The app's interface should be intuitive to use. For example, the input text area to filter locations should be easy to locate. It should be easy to understand what set of locations is being filtered. Selecting a location via list item or map marker should cause the map marker to bounce or in some other way animate to indicate that the location has been selected and associated info window should open above map marker with additional information.
